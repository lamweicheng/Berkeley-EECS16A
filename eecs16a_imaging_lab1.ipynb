    "## Imaging Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab in the imaging module! The goal of this module is to build the imaging system introduced in class. The physical components of this system include a pico projector, ambient light sensor, some passive electronics, and a [TI MSP430 Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html?DCMP=rtos&HQS=ep-sdo-rtos-pr-lp-launchpad-en) microcontroller. The complete setup of the imaging system is shown below. \n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/old_setup.jpg\" style=\"width:550px\" />\n",

    "\n",
    "We will not be using the projector or stand today; you will build the complete setup in the next lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='overview'></a>\n",
    "### System Overview\n",
    "The following figure shows a high-level block model of our imaging system. Here is the system flow: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ambient light sensor converts light energy into electrical current; more ambient light leads to more current. \n",
    "2. The current produced by the ambient light sensor then travels through passive electrical components. This translates the current into a detectable signal (a voltage signal). \n",
    "3. The TI Launchpad reads this signal, digitizes it, and sends it to the PC. \n",
    "4. The digitized signal gets converted into an image by some linear algebra code written in your Jupyter (iPython) notebook. Further improvements are made via software to increase the quality of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/systemdiagram.png\" style=\"height:300px\" />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images are composed of a grid of [pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), each of which represents a single color. To create a digital representation, optical imaging systems measure the energy, equivalent to light in this case, reflected off of objects to determine the values of these pixels. Because different colors reflect different amounts of light, measurements of reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between colors.\n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/overview.svg\" style=\"height:256px\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial cameras, such as those found in smartphones, use chips called CMOS image sensors to measure millions of pixel values at a time (think of this as millions of devices akin to the ambient light sensor that all fit on an approximately 30mm$^2$ chip). In contrast, our system can only measure one light intensity value at a time, so we will instead use a controlled energy source, the projector, to illuminate specific regions of the image. We then use the ambient light sensor to record the energy that reflects off of those regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ambient light sensor converts light to induce a flow of electrons. The circuit then outputs a voltage that changes in real time, depending on the light intensity. The voltage can be thought of as a real \"analog\" value, serving as a starting point for being able to represent our image on a computer. We use a microcontroller (Launchpad) to take samples of the voltage signal and convert them to a set of digital numbers that we can then use in our Jupyter (iPython) notebook.\n",

Don't feel intimidated if you don't know what these things are. **At this point in the course, you are NOT expected to know what these components are or what they are supposed to do.** You will eventually master these components during the circuits part of 16A.

    "A voltage is defined as a difference in electric potential between two points. For example, the voltage source we will be using in this lab has a potential difference of $+3.3V$ between its positive and negative terminals. Because a voltage must be defined across two points, it is often convenient to define a common point in a circuit as a reference. This reference voltage, commonly referred to as \"ground\" (GND), is defined by convention to be $0V$, and therefore allows us to conveniently describe voltages at any point in the circuit with respect to $0V$.

The 5 holes in each row (ABCDE or FGHIJ) are electrically connected to each other within the breadboard (underneath the plastic) so we can imagine tiny jumper wires connecting all of the 5 holes to each other. Since these 5 holes are connected, they are all on the same node and should have the same potential. The 2 columns of holes (a red +  and blue - column) on the side of your breadboard are often referred to as the power rails. Instead of horizontal internal connections, the power rails are connected vertically all the way down the side.\n",
