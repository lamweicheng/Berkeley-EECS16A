You will experiment with imaging methods that illuminate *multiple pixels* at a time. You'll find that if we design our masks in a clever way, our imaging system can be much more robust to noise than the single-pixel approach. You will generate a binary mask matrix that the projector will use to illuminate multi-pixel patterns onto your object. Before scanning your custom images, you'll walk through a basic multi-pixel imaging simulation to understand how it works, delve deeper into the differences between ideal and non-ideal imaging, and understand why certain matrices are better than others at imaging in noisy systems.\n",

Recall from Imaging 2 that the projector setup is usually placed inside a cardboard box to prevent light from the outside world disturbing our sensor.

The sensor and related circuits generate noise in our measurements due to thermal physics and other environmental factors. The refresh rate of the projector also contributes to noise. Thus, non-idealities like noise will inevitably be present in our setup. This is a limitation of the real-world setup that greatly affects our ability to reconstruct the image using the light sensor data.

Unfortunately, due to real-world non-idealities alluded to earlier, if you directly tried to image a drawing with the multipixel masks in $H$, the reconstruction would probably look terrible.

Noise is what causes photos to look grainy or fuzzy. As an example, if your single pixel imaging system from last week happened to be very noisy (and usually, the cheaper the system, the noisier it is...), imaging the card from before might've produced something like: <br/><br/>\n",
