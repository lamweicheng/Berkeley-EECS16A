For sensing, sensors are used to \"transduce\" or convert physical quantities to electrical signals. The electrical signals are then conditioned and processed for different application needs. Finally, as an optional step, actuators are used to bring about physical change back into the tangible world. In this lab, we will use a capacitive touchpad to sense a touch, process the resulting electrical signal using a combination of additional circuit elements, and then actuate an indicator, an LED, to indicate that a touch has been detected."
